# GRANDcast APP

This is a Study Project using the full stack framework GRANDstack, following the guidance of William Lyon's [blog](https://lyonwj.com/blog/grandstack-podcast-app-podcast-search-graphql-api).

Through this project I get a brief concept of the Neo4j graph database and explore the power of GraphQL and Apollo.
